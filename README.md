# File Organizer
This program does the ff:

 - List all the files in a directory.
 - Make a folder for each file type.
 - Place each file in its appropriate file folder.
 - Delete duplicate files.
 - Rename each file with a unique value.

Edit **directory-path.json** with folder path:
```
{	
	"directory_path":  "folder_path",
	"file_types": []
}
```
